# Final Capstone

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
Final Capstone project to complete the full-stack Java development bootcamp through Tech Elevator. Collaborated with a team of bootcamp students to implement a full-stack, single page web application designed with Java, Vue.js, and a PostgreSQL database. The app consumes the Discogs API to allow for searching records and displaying album art and information. Users can add records to their collection, write custom notes and tags, post their collections publicly, search for records to add, and view other users’ collections.
